Following the theodinproject.com Foundations lesson to refresh my fundamental web development skills, intending to eventually move into the full stack javascript lesson. I've mostly used React and built using the create-react-app command so it'll be nice to build from the ground up (maybe. I'm doing it for now, anyway).

I'm not sure if they're going to be the same repo or not, I assume I'll make a new one but I'll keep this here to prove I can follow instructions? Idk, i've had fun following the lessons so may as well keep it I think.
