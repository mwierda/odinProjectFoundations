# Odin Project Landing Page

<https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page>

Following their example images to create a full page using what they've taught so far along with whatever else I need to look up. May end up splitting this off into its own repo, but tbh probably just gonna wait for the full-stack javascript course to do that I think. Maybe will just copy/paste this over if/when that happens if I don't wanna remake it.
