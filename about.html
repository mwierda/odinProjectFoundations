      I'm fairly active, I've loved CrossFit for a while and used to train competitively for it in college.
      I wasn't ever any good, but that's okay haha. Recently I've picked up rollerblading and snowboarding which
      have been super fun, and am generally down to do most active things for fun with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I also love fantasy, some sci-fi, books, movies, video games, anime, and other assorted geeky
      things. I've been on a computer for a large portion of my life (explains a lot) and don't plan on stopping
      anytime soon. I'm not super big into any one in particular, I tend to just cycle through them throughout
      the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think cognitive science, human biases, and psychology are also super interesting. I found the website LessWrong
      after reading their science-y Harry Potter fanfiction and ever since have tried my best to be a more
      thoughtful, caring, and rational person. I'm getting there.

  <h3>Professional Interests</h3>

    <p>
      So far I've done mainly web development, and have really enjoyed it! In college I kinda thought I'd
      enjoy backend, database work more but after doing more front end work at my first job I found making
      interactable components and being able to really see what I'm coding come to life was really enjoyable,
      so I've mainly stuck with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I'm fairly easy to get along with, sometimes maybe too much as in the past I've definitely
      held back on suggestions or disagreements due partially to that, partially to inexperience. At this
      point I feel much more confident giving suggestions or asking questions as to why something is done
      a certain way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently looking to solidify my front end knowledge, primarily by focusing on how to improve page
      performance, inspired by McMaster-Carr's website (which is crazy fast, it's amazing). I'd also like
      to learn more about some backend setup, which I'm going to do by following the Odin Foundations course
      which I've been having fun following.

      I don't actually have anyting else to put here, but I feel the urge to include a third section. Oh,
      maybe I could include pictures of pets my friends have, but not me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Makes me sad I don't have one, but they're really cute, so it's okay.
      I'll add them eventually, promise!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I like the color purple. If you haven't noticed. Shades of blue are also definitely just a nice,
      soothing website color. Puts me at ease.
